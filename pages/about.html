            <article>
                <p>
                    Dungeons & Dragons is a roleplaying tabletop game where you have the dungeon master (DM) and the
                    players.
                    The DM creates and narrates a story for the players to play through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The players make characters that have classes and races, while the DM plays as the non-player
                    characters (NPCs).
