            <h3>My Opinion</h3>
            <p>Dungeons & Dragons is one of my favorite games to play; sadly it is seen as satanic by some people and I
                want them to know that it is as bad as you make it. </p>

            <h5>The New 2024 Rules</h5>
            <p>
                A lot of controversy has arrisen about the 2024 rules, on whether they should be used or not.<br>
                We gain some new feats, better races, a lot of things updated, and some new subclasses. I think everybody should accept a the new rules and get overthemselves.
